# Claude Artifact Runner

Claude Artifact Runner is an interactive web application for showcasing and exploring various web development artifacts, mainly those generated by Claude AI. This React-based tool allows users to view, search, and interact with both React components and HTML files in a unified interface. It's ideal for educational purposes, code demonstrations, and component libraries.

## Features

- Display and interact with React components and HTML artifacts
- Search and filter artifacts by name, category, and description
- Sort artifacts by various properties (name, category, version)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing
- Built-in instructions for adding new artifacts
- Error handling and loading states for improved user experience

## Installation

To set up the Claude Artifact Runner on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mamertofabian/claude-artifact-runner.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd claude-artifact-runner
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Browse through the list of available artifacts
- Use the search bar to find specific artifacts by name or description
- Filter artifacts by category using the dropdown menu
- Sort artifacts by clicking on the column headers (Name, Category, Version)
- Click on an artifact to view its details and interact with it
- For HTML artifacts, the content will be displayed in an iframe
- For React component artifacts, the component will be rendered directly

To return to the main list from an artifact view, click the "Back to List" button.

## Adding New Artifacts

To add a new artifact to the runner:

1. For React components:

   - Create a new file in the `src/artifacts/` directory (e.g., `NewArtifact.js`)
   - Create and export your artifact as a default React component
   - Import your new artifact in the main Artifact Runner component

2. For HTML files:

   - Create a new HTML file in the `public/artifacts/html/` directory (e.g., `new-artifact.html`)
   - Ensure your HTML file is self-contained (includes any necessary CSS and JavaScript)

3. Add a new entry to the `defaultArtifacts` array in the main Artifact Runner component:

   ```javascript
   {
     id: 'unique-id-for-new-artifact',
     name: 'New Artifact Name',
     component: NewArtifact, // for React components
     path: '/artifacts/html/new-artifact.html', // for HTML files
     category: 'Your Category',
     description: 'Brief description of your artifact.',
     version: '1.0.0',
     type: 'react', // or 'html' for HTML files
   }
   ```

4. Save all changes and restart your development server if necessary
